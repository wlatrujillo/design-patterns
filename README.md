# Design Patterns

## Multi-Module Project

### Strategy pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them
interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of 
clients that use it.

### Observer pattern

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes
state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Decorator Pattern

Attaches additional responsabilities to an object dynamically.
Decorator provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending
functionality.

### Factory Pattern

Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to 
subclasses.

### Singleton Pattern

Ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access
to it.

### Command Pattern

Encapsulates a request as an object, letting you parameterize other objects 
with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
